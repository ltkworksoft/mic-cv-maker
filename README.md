# C++ Tutorial

# What is a compiler?
Computers understand only one language and that language consists of sets of instructions made of "1" and "0"s. It's 
called: **machine language**.
A single instruction to a computer could look like this:

|       |          |
|-------|----------|
| 00000 | 10011110 |

It's very hard to program directly in machine language. So to make it easier, high level languages have been developed.
Example of a code in C++:
```c++
int a, b, sum;

cin >> a;
cin >> b;
cout << sum << endl;
```

Because computer can only understand **machine language**, programs written in human understanding language should be 
re-written (translated) into machine language. This is done by special programs called compilers, interpreters or 
assemblers that are built into the various programming applications.

C++ is designed to be a compiled language, meaning that it is generally translated into machine language that can 
be understood directly by the system, making the generated program highly efficient. Fot that, a set of tools are needed, 
known as the development toolchain, whose core are a compiler and its linker.

# Console Program
Console programs are programs that use text to communicate with the user and the environment, such as printing text to 
the screen or reading input from a keyboard. The way to compile console programs depends on the particular tool you are
using.

# Structure of a program
A first program example:
```c++
// my first program in c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
}
```

Let's analyse the code:
- Line 1: `// my first program in c++`<br>
Two slash signs indicate that the rest of the line is a comment inserted by the programmer but which has no effect on 
the behavior of the program. They are used usually to leave some explanations concerning the code or program.
- Line 2: `#include <iostream>`<br>
Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives read and interpreted by what is known as the **preprocessor**. They 
are special lines interpreted before compilation of the program itself begins. In this case, the directive 
`#include <iostream>` instructs the preprocessor to include a section of standard C++ code, known as **header iostream**, 
that allows to perform standard input and output operations, such as writing the output of this program (Hello World) to 
the screen.
- Line 3: Blank Line
- Line 4: `int main()`<br>
This line initiates the declaration of a function. Function is a group of code statements which are given a name: in this 
case, this gives the name "main" to the group of code statements that follow. Its type an integer (int).
- Line 5 and 7: `{` and `}`<br>
The open brace (`{`) indicates the beginning of main's function definition, and the closing brace (`}`) indicates its end.
- Line 6: `std::cout << "Hello World!"`<br>
This line is a C++ statement. A statement is an expression that can actually produce some effect. It is the meat of a 
program, specifying its actual behavior. Statements are executed in the same order that they appear within a function's 
body.
This statement has three parts: 
  - First, `std::cout`, which identifies the **st**andar**d** **c**haracter **out**put device (usually, this is the 
  computer screen).
  - Second, the insertion operator (`<<`), which indicates that the follows is inserted into `std::cout`.
  - Finally, a sentence within quotes (`"Hello World!"`), is the content inserted into the standard output.
<br>

Notice that statement ends with a semicolon (;). This character marks the end of the statement, just as the period ends 
a sentence in English. All C++ statements must ends with semicolon. **One of the most common syntax errors in C++ is 
forgetting end a statement with a semicolon.
<br>

The program has been structured in different lines and properly indented, in order to make it easier to understand for 
the humans reading it. But C++ does not have strict rules on indentation or on how to split instructions in different 
lines. For example, instead of writing the code above, we can also have the same result with:
```c++
// my first program in c++
#include <iostream>
int main() { std::cout << "Hello World!"; }
```

# Comments
C++ supports two wats of commenting code:
1. `// line comment`
2. `/* block comment */`

Example:
```c++
/* my second program in C++ 
   with more comments */
   
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!";  // prints Hello World!
    std::cout << "I'm a C++ program"; // prints I'm a C++ program
}
```

# Using namespace std
`cout` is part of the standard library, and all the elements in the standard C++ library are declared within what is 
called a *namespace*: the namespace std.
In order to refer to the elements in the `std` namespace a program shall either qualify each and every use of elements 
of the library or introduce visibility of its components. The most typical way to introduce visibility of these components 
is by means of using declarations:
`using namespace std;`

Example:
```c++
// my second program in C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    cout << "I'm a C++ program";
}
```

# Variables and types
## Identifiers
A valid identifier is a sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (`_`).

| Not Allowed in identifier     |
|-------------------------------|
| Spaces                        |
| Punctuation marks (. , ; ...) |
| Symbols (@, $, %...)          |

In addition, identifier must always begin with a letter. They can also begin with underscore character (`_`), but such 
identifiers are -on most cases- considered reserved for compiler-specific keywords or external identifiers, as well as 
identifiers containing two successive underscore characters anywhere. In no case can they begin with a digit.

Identifiers created by a programmer cannot match these keywords. The standard reserved keywords that cannot be used for 
programmer created identifiers are:
`alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class, 
compl, const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum, 
explicit, export, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept, 
not, not_eq, nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short, 
signed, sizeof, static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, 
try, typedef, typeid, typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq`

#### Specific compilers may also have additional specific reserved keywords.
#### C++ is a case-sensitive language, that means: the identifier `player` is different from `Player` or `plaYER`

# Fundamental data types
The value of variables are stored somewhere in an unspecified location in the computer memory as zeros and ones. Our 
program does not need to know the exact location where a variable is stored; it can simply refer to it by its name. 
What the program needs to be aware of is the kind of data stored in the variable. It's not the same store a simple 
integer as it is to store a letter or a large floating-point number; event though they are all represented using zeros 
and ones, they are not interpreted in the same way, and in many cases, they don't occupy the same amount of memory.

Fundamental data types can mainly be classified into:
* Character types: they can represent a single character, such as 'A' or '$'
* Numerical integer types: they can store a whole number value such as 7 or 10958. They exist in a variety of sizes, 
and can either be **signed** or **unsigned**
* Floating-point types: they can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different level of precision.
* Boolean type: The boolean type, known in C++ as bool, can only represent two states, true or false.

This table provides an overview of fundamental data types in C++, grouped by category and with notes on their size 
and precision.

| Group                        | Type Names               | Notes on Size / Precision                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Character Types**          | `char`                   | Exactly one byte in size. At least 8 bits.         |
|                              | `char16_t`               | Not smaller than `char`. At least 16 bits.         |
|                              | `char32_t`               | Not smaller than `char16_t`. At least 32 bits.     |
|                              | `wchar_t`                | Can represent the largest supported character set. |
| **Integer Types (signed)**   | `signed char`            | Same size as `char`. At least 8 bits.              |
|                              | `signed short int`       | Not smaller than `char`. At least 16 bits.         |
|                              | `signed int`             | Not smaller than `short`. At least 16 bits.        |
|                              | `signed long int`        | Not smaller than `int`. At least 32 bits.          |
|                              | `signed long long int`   | Not smaller than `long`. At least 64 bits.         |
| **Integer Types (unsigned)** | `unsigned char`          | Same size as signed counterpart.                   |
|                              | `unsigned short int`     | Same size as signed counterpart.                   |
|                              | `unsigned int`           | Same size as signed counterpart.                   |
|                              | `unsigned long int`      | Same size as signed counterpart.                   |
|                              | `unsigned long long int` | Same size as signed counterpart.                   |
| **Floating-Point Types**     | `float`                  |                                                    |
|                              | `double`                 | Precision not less than `float`.                   |
|                              | `long double`            | Precision not less than `double`.                  |
| **Boolean Type**             | `bool`                   |                                                    |
| **Void Type**                | `void`                   | No storage.                                        |
| **Null Pointer**             | `decltype(nullptr)`      |                                                    |


Type sizes above are expressed in bits; the more bits a type has, the more distinct values it can represent, but as the 
time, also consumes more space in memory:

| Size   | Unique representable values | Notes                        |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 8-bit  | 256                         | = 2^8                        |
| 16-bit | 65536                       | = 2^16                       |
| 32-bit | 4294967296                  | = 2^32 (~4 billion)          |
| 64-bit | 18446744073709551616        | = 2^64 (~18 billion billion) |

The properties of fundamental types in a particular system and compiler implementation can be obtained by using the 
<u>numeric_limits</u> classes (see standard header [limits](https://cplusplus.com/%3Climits%3E)). If for some reason, 
types of specific sizes are needed, the library defines certain fixed-size type aliases in header 
[cstdint](https://cplusplus.com/%3Ccstdint%3E).

The types described above are collectively known as arithmetic types. But two additional fundamental types exist: `void`, 
which identifies the lack of type; and the type `nullptr`, which is a special type of pointer. Both types will be discussed 
further in a coming chapter about pointers.

# Declaration of variables
C++ is a strongly-typed language, and requires every variable to be declared with its type before its first use.
EXAMPLE:
```c++
int a;
float mynumber;
```

We can declare variables of the same type in a single statement.
Example:
```c++
int a, b, c;
```
This same as
```c++
int a;
int b;
int c;
```

An example of usage:
```c++
// operating with variables;

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // declaring variables
    int a, b;
    int result;
    
    // process
    a = 5;
    b = 2;
    a = a + 1;
    result = a - b;
    
    // print out the result:
    cout << result;
    
    // terminate the program1:
    return 0;
}
// output is: 4
```

# Initialization of variables
When variables in the example above are declared, they have an undetermined value until they are assigned a value for 
the first time. But it is possible for a variable to have a specific value from the moment is declared. This is called 
the initialization of the variable.

There are three ways to initialize variables in C++:

| Initialization                   | Form                               | Example       |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| c-like (inherited from C)        | `type identifier = initial_value;` | `int x = 0';` |
| constructor                      | `type identifier(initial_value);`  | `int x(0);`   |
| uniform (introduced in C++ 2011) | `type identifier{initial_value};`  | `int x{0};`   |

Example:
```c++
// Initialization of variables

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b(3);
    int c{2};
    int result;
    
    a = a + b;
    result = a - c;
    cout << result;
    
    return 0;
}
```
